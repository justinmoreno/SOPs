\section{Introduction}

This SOP details the operation of the FXR system in the HyFIRE facility. The FXR system is used to create an X-Ray image of a target before, during, or after an experiment in the terminal tank. 
Images from the FXR system are collected using phosphor screens and then processed using the Duerr NDT HR ScanX scanner to create a digital image.
